Our deployed app can be viewed at this link: https://our-checkout-app.herokuapp.com/

Ours is an open-source store where anyone can edit the inventory using the RESTful API [here](https://our-checkout-app.herokuapp.com/api/items/)

Items can be added to the cart using the plus buttons and removed from cart using the minus buttons. The cart total will automatically update. A secret discount can be applied by pressing a super secret discount button (in the bottom-left corner).
